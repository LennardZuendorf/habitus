# Habitus

#### Habitus was created as part of HTW Berlin's Webtech course. It's a classic habit/goal-tracking web app. Originally based on Java, Spring, and Thymeleaf with Vue.js via cdn.
#### Now (on the path to) a Java and Spring Boot monolith with a Thymeleaf-served HTML and React.js frontend. I use Keycloak, PostgreSQL, and Liquibase, which all run in docker containers.
